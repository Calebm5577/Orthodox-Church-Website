                    <p class="main-textbox-parish-history-text">&nbsp;&nbsp; St. George Orthodox church was founded in 1915 by serbian immigrants. We have always been a relatively small and tight nit community 
                        currently serving just under 1,200 people.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally St. George Orthodox church was called St. George Serbian Orthodox Church but this changed in
                     1960 to remove "Serbian" and keep "St. George". This was done to not scare away newcomers to Orthodoxy as the name implied an ethnic cult
                    despite the meaning only representing the imigirants original country.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; We never wanted to change our Patron Saint from St. George however due to our origins 
                    all the way up to the  present of being a military community. Our chosen Saint being a military Martyr represents our attitudes as both  Soldiers and Christians</p>
